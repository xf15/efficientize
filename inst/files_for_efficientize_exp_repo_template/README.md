# csl

## my_abstract_short_bib.csl

adapted apa6.csl, replaced its citation part with citation part from ieee, replaced its bib part with its citation part, modify bib part by removing things in layout tag, add text section for citation-number. removed sort section.

i think it's the standard bibliography setting that says each reference starts on a new line. cannot do anything about that. tweak in word

^ did for camp2021


or let's generate pdf, copy bib from pdf and paste to rmd, suppress bib in csl.

^ never did that
