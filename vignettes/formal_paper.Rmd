# Introduction 


How are you? Thank you. I am fine. And you?

I am fine too. 
```{r}
L3 <- LETTERS[1:3]
fac <- sample(L3, 10, replace = TRUE)

d <- data.frame(x = 1, y = 1:10, fac = fac)
```

# Method

```{r}
# i am just a comment. My initial doesn't need to be capitalized. Or do i?
1 + 1
```

$$
p(\theta_i|x, c) \propto p(x|\theta_i, c) p(\theta_i)
$$
